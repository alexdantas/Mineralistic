_Mineralistic_ is a 2014 summer project I'm making on **C++** with **SFML**.

It's a 2D Platformer set in an infinite random generated world
where the player spawns below the surface.
He'll be able to collect minerals found in the dungeon to create
and upgrade equipment.
The goal of the game is to get deep down into the earth to find
more exclusive and rare materials.
If the player dies, the game is lost and the highscore is saved.
